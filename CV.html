    <h2>Amna Yousaf</h2>
    <strong>Quran Teacher</strong>
    <hr>
  <h3>About:</h3>
 <p> I am working as a quran teacher.I am dedicated to guiding students in their journey
     to understand and appreciate the sacred text of the Quran. My approach involves not
      only teaching the proper recitation and memorization of verses but also delving 
      into the profound meanings and context behind the words. I strive to create an 
      engaging and supportive learning environment where students can ask questions, 
      share insights, and grow in their faith. By incorporating traditional methods 
      with modern educational techniques, I aim to foster a deep and lasting 
       connection between students and the divine wisdom of the Quran</p>
